[Voxcraft-viz](https://github.com/voxcraft/voxcraft-viz), which was originally forked from [VoxCAD](https://github.com/jonhiller/VoxCAD), is a visualization tool for [voxcraft-sim](https://github.com/voxcraft/voxcraft-sim).

You can learn more about the whole voxcraft project (not just software) [here](https://voxcraft.github.io/).


### drawing a robot in viz

You can draw a custom robot in voxcraft-viz using your mouse and then press play to watch its behavior.

### playing a history file in viz

voxcraft-viz can also be used to replay the behavior of robots that have already been simulated elsewhere: 
their **history**.

You can download one of these prerecorded history files 

[**`m190.history`**](https://github.com/voxcraft/voxcraft-viz/raw/master/demos/m190.history)
&nbsp;&nbsp;
[**`m805.history`**](https://github.com/voxcraft/voxcraft-viz/raw/master/demos/m805.history)

and replay it in voxcraft-viz:

# Installation

## On Linux
```
sudo snap install voxcraft-viz
```

The first time executing `voxcraft-viz` will take 2 minutes, due to that snap need to set up a sandbox for the executable.

More detail about installation: 

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/voxcraft-viz)

## On Mac

We don't provide binary version for Mac (because the developers cannot afford Mac's). However, you can build the project from source code. [Here is a simple tutorial for that](InstallOnMac.md).


## On Windows
On Win10, you can download the software 
[here](https://github.com/voxcraft/voxcraft-viz/raw/master/bin/voxcraft-viz-win10-x64.7z).
