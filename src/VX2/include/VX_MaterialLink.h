//!Defines the homogenous material properties of a link connecting two voxels.
/*!The constructor takes the two voxel materials and calculates the "best" material properties of a third material that captures the physical behavior. Beam constants are precomputed to quick access during simulation.

If the two input voxel materials are identical then this material is applied and beam constants are precomputed.

If the materials are different a third material is carefully crafted from the two and beam constants precomputed.
